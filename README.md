# Email-Formalizer-using-Generative-AI
This project leverages Generative AI to transform casual, informal user input into polished, professional emails. Using the power of pre-trained language models (LLaMA3 8B via Groq API), the system generates grammatically correct and contextually relevant formal emails.
Project Overview
The Email Formalizer system is designed to assist users in converting informal text into professionally structured email messages. The project uses a Generative AI model, specifically the LLaMA3 8B model, for text generation and Streamlit for the user interface. This system is useful for anyone who needs to communicate formally but struggles with phrasing or structuring sentences appropriately.
Key Features:


Converts casual user input into a formal, professional email.


Powered by the LLaMA3 8B model via the Groq API.


User-friendly interface built using Streamlit.
