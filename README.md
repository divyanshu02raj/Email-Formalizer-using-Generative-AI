# Email Formalizer using Generative AI

This project leverages Generative AI to transform casual, informal user input into polished, professional emails. Using the power of pre-trained language models (LLaMA3 8B via Groq API), the system generates grammatically correct and contextually relevant formal emails.

## Project Overview

The **Email Formalizer** system is designed to assist users in converting informal text into professionally structured email messages. The project uses a Generative AI model, specifically the **LLaMA3 8B model**, for text generation and **Streamlit** for the user interface. This system is useful for anyone who needs to communicate formally but struggles with phrasing or structuring sentences appropriately.

### Key Features:
- Converts casual user input into a formal, professional email.
- Powered by the LLaMA3 8B model via the Groq API.
- User-friendly interface built using Streamlit.

## Installation Instructions

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/divyanshu02raj/Email-Formalizer-using-Generative-AI.git
cd email-formalizer
```

### Step 2: Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows, use `venv\Scriptsctivate`
```

### Step 3: Install the required dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the Streamlit app in your web browser, where you can interact with the email formalizer.

## Usage

1. Enter an informal sentence into the text input field on the Streamlit app.
2. The system will generate a formal email based on the provided input, displaying it below the input field.
3. You can use the generated email to refine and send as your formal communication.

Example:
- **Input:** "Hey, can you send me the report?"
- **Output:** "Dear [Name], I hope you are well. Could you kindly send me the report at your earliest convenience?"

## Testing

The system was tested across multiple scenarios to ensure its robustness and accuracy. The testing phase included:
- **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components for functionality.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensuring smooth interaction between the user input and model.
- **User Testing:** Collecting feedback from test users regarding the interface and output quality.
- **Performance Testing:** Evaluating the systemâ€™s response time with various input sizes.

## Results

- **Accuracy:** The system successfully generated contextually relevant and grammatically correct formal emails.
- **Response Time:** The application performed optimally, providing quick responses.
- **Edge Cases:** The model handled incomplete or nonsensical inputs by returning plausible formal responses (e.g., "Could you please clarify your request?").

## Future Work

- **Model Fine-tuning:** Fine-tuning the model on professional email datasets to improve context-specific responses.
- **Real-time Collaboration Feature:** Enabling multiple users to collaborate on email generation.
- **User Feedback Loop:** Allowing users to provide feedback on generated emails to improve system performance.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Supporting multiple languages to cater to a global audience.
- **Contextual Enhancements:** Allowing the system to handle more complex email dialogues.
